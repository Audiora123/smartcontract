Social Restaking Pools (Audio DAOs)
struct AudioDAO {
    uint256 daoId;
    address creator;
    string name;
    address[] members;
    uint256 totalStaked;
    mapping(address => uint256) memberStakes;
    uint256 yield;
}
mapping(uint256 => AudioDAO) public audioDAOs;

b) Cross-Chain Staking & Dynamic Routing
struct StakeRoute {
    address user;
    uint256 amount;
    string originChain;
    string destinationChain;
    address creator;
    uint256 timestamp;
    uint256 estimatedYield;
}
mapping(address => StakeRoute[]) public stakeRoutes;
event StakeRouted(address indexed user, string fromChain, string toChain, uint256 amount);

c) Viral Audio Bounties
struct AudioBounty {
    uint256 bountyId;
    address creator;
    uint256 totalPool;
    uint256 milestone; // e.g., number of listens or shares
    uint256 currentProgress;
    bool isActive;
    mapping(address => bool) hasClaimed;
    address[] eligibleListeners;
}
mapping(uint256 => AudioBounty) public bounties;

d) AI-Generated Restake Suggestions
(Smart contracts donâ€™t handle AI logic directly, but a stub can store history)
struct ListeningHistory {
    address user;
    address[] listenedCreators;
    uint256[] listenTimestamps;
    mapping(address => uint256) stakeHistory;
}
mapping(address => ListeningHistory) public histories;

e) Restake Yield From Creator to Creator
struct CreatorRestake {
    address fromCreator;
    address toCreator;
    uint256 amount;
    address user;
    uint256 timestamp;
}
event RestakePerformed(address user, address fromCreator, address toCreator, uint256 amount);
mapping(address => CreatorRestake[]) public restakeLogs;

 2) BACKEND STRUCTURE 
a) Social Restaking Pools (Audio DAOs)
Database Tables / Collections:
audio_daos: { dao_id, name, creator, total_staked, yield }
dao_members: { dao_id, user_id, stake_amount }
Backend Services:
DAO Creation API
Join/Leave DAO API
Aggregate pool yield & distribute rewards
Stake within DAO

b) Cross-Chain Staking & Dynamic Routing
Database:
stake_routes: { user_id, amount, from_chain, to_chain, creator_id, est_yield, status }
Backend Services:
Cross-chain bridge interaction 
Dynamic path optimization engine (yield estimator)
Route management queue (Redis for queues, workers for execution)

c) Viral Audio Bounties
Database:
audio_bounties: { bounty_id, creator_id, pool_amount, milestone_type, milestone_target, current_progress, is_active }
bounty_claims: { user_id, bounty_id, claimed_at }

Backend Services:
Engagement Tracker (listens, shares via webhooks/API calls)
Bounty Distribution Engine (triggers payouts on milestone completion)
Viral Analytics (who contributed most to virality)

d) AI-Generated Restake Suggestions
Database:
user_behavior_logs: { user_id, creator_id, interaction_type, timestamp }
ai_recommendations: { user_id, recommended_creator_ids[] }

Backend Services:
Listening/Staking analytics pipeline
AI model service (could be separate Python ML microservice using collaborative filtering or Transformers)
API for real-time suggestions

e) Restake Yield From Creator to Creator
Database:
restake_logs: { user_id, from_creator_id, to_creator_id, amount, timestamp }

Backend Services:

Restake Flow Engine (validates source yield balance, redirects to destination creator)
Notification Service (in-app notification when restake happens)
Scheduled auto-restake rules (user-defined triggers)
